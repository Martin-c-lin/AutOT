Try to make a single API on which one can build other applications.

Add possibility to "home" motors to a presaved location.

Make it possible to build different applications on using these basic building blocks.

Consider splitting c_p into different subdictionaries, one per thread.
Then we would have for instance c_p_temperature(),c_p_camera etc
Could make each thread add its necessary parameters to c_p itself.

Investigate if I can replace c_p with something similar to events for the
threads.

Make it so that stepper and "normal motors" implement the same interface

Simplify and unify the naming in the c_p. For instance; replace
motor_starting_position with motorStartPos.

Move ExperimentControlThread into a spearate file similar to what I did with the
 QD_tracking. stepper_target_position -> stepTargPos
