Try to make a single API on which one can build other applications.
Have c_p as input to the different threads and put the threads in separate files.
EX - temperature thread in temperature_controller file.

Make it possible to build different applications on using these basic building blocks.

Consider splitting c_p into different subdictionaries, one per thread.
Then we would have for instance c_p_temperature(),c_p_camera etc

Add manual controls of shutter, set shutter open time and open shutter.
Also add ... to it

Manual control of piezos/steppers? Have user press on screen where the
laser should be moved to?

Investigate if I can replace c_p with something similar to events for the
threads.

Make it so that stepper and "normal motors" implement the same interface
